# Images
Repo used to host images and then access them with a link in looker.

You can access them with the following url : ```tmitdata.github.io/images/[name_of_your_image_with_extension]```

Then, to use them in Looker, define a html parameter of a field as follows :
```html: <img src='[url_of_the_image]/>```
